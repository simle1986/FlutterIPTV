## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Adding IPTV Playlists

#### 🌍 Free Public Playlists
For testing and demonstration purposes, you can use this free public playlist:
```
https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.m3u
```

**How to add:**
1. Open Lotus IPTV
2. Click "Add Playlist" or "+" button
3. Select "From URL"
4. Paste the URL above
5. Click "Add" and wait for channels to load

#### 📁 Other Playlist Sources
- **Local Files**: Import `.m3u` or `.m3u8` files from your device
- **Custom URLs**: Add your own IPTV service URLs
- **QR Code**: Scan QR codes containing playlist URLs

> **Note**: The public playlist above contains channels from various countries and may have varying availability. For the best experience, use playlists from your IPTV service provider.
